In general, the site has become more interactive. I added an EventListener to the main page so that the part with the Recipe of the Week changes the background and text color on hover. The validation form has been updated, now JavaScript is used instead of bootstrap. Warnings are displayed if you enter incorrectly. Also on the main page, the recipe sheet was hidden using JS. Each recipe page (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner) has a to-do list so that users can manually write down the cooking steps or keep a list of products directly on the site. There is also a cooking time next to the recipe names so people can use the animated countdown timer. The countdown timer displays user feedbacks that indicate the start or end of the timer.
